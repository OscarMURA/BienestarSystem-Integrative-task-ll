// The code snippet is defining an enumeration called `Sex`. An enumeration is a special type in Java
// that represents a fixed set of constants. In this case, the `Sex` enumeration has three constants:
// `O`, `M`, and `F`. These constants can be used to represent different sexes or genders in a program.
